// Separate keys with tabs
// Base - DON'T CHANGE THE ORDER
// extendedcrashchecking will use RCON heartbeat concept, if there is no reply from the server within 3 sec it will be restarted, currently this command will restart servers when they changemap, still WIP!
// hidewindow will hide the srcds.exe window, you can write any commands via the SRCDS Monitor interface as if you typed it in the srcds server interface.
// game is just a name and is not mandatory.
// REMEMBER to set the right port, otherwise 27015 will be used.
// DISCLAIMER: A random rcon_password will be chosen everytime you launch the app.
// IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS FOR A GOLDSRC MOD/GAME, CHANGE srcds TO hlds! <- Will enforce goldsrc.
