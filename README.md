# Source Dedicated Server Monitor
This is a simple application which basically handles crashing, freezing and such @ your SRCDS server(s).
You can manually restart, easily add in customized cvars, launch options via the server_config.txt file.

Non-built in commands will be executed via Source RCON to the linked server.
Whenever the server crashes you'll be notified with the timestamp as well.
